Express & Next.js Project
This project combines an Express.js backend and a Next.js frontend to create a full-stack web application. The Express server handles API requests, specifically CRUD operations for user management, while Next.js provides the frontend interface.
## Installation

Running Express Server
To run the Express server:

Navigate to the "server" folder.
Install dependencies using either Yarn or npm.
Copy environment variables from .env.example to create a .env file.
Ensure PostgreSQL is running and properly configured.
Start the server using Yarn or npm.
The server utilizes Prisma to connect with PostgreSQL. The CRUD API for users can be accessed at localhost:3000/v1/users.


Running Next.js Client
To run the Next.js client:

Navigate to the "client" folder.
Install dependencies using npm or Yarn.
Copy environment variables from .env.example to create a .env file.
Start the Next.js development server using npm or Yarn.
The CRUD interface is available at localhost:3001.
